GoTools is the name of a collection of C++ libraries related to
geometry. The libraries are organized as a core module with additional
modules added on top. The core module contains generic tools and
spline functionality. The additional modules contain functionality for
intersections, approximative implicitization, parametrization,
topology, and more.

This toolkit contains the modules GoTools Core, Parametrization,
Implicitization, Intersections, Igeslib, Trivariate, TrivariateModel,
CompositeModel, Topology, Viewlib, IsogeometricModel, LRsplines2D and
QualityModule. Also included is SISL, TTL and Newmat for convenience.

The GoTools geometry/spline toolkit was written by the Geometry Group
at SINTEF ICT, Department of Applied Mathematics.

Newmat was written by Robert Davies, http://www.robertnz.com.

Requirements:
* CMake - see: www.cmake.org
* For Viewlib only: Qt4, OpenGL, GLUT, Boost
* Linux: Tested with gcc version 4.7.3
* Windows: Tested with Visual Studio 2010. Should work on VS 2008.

A few comments on the current distribution:

(1) You can generate doxygen information by typing 'doxygen' in the base
    directory.
(2) In order to compile/install the library, you need to use CMake. See 
    the INSTALL file.
(3) GoTools provides a file format: g2. Various test applications
    produce g2 files as output. See the Doxygen generated
    documentation for more information on this format. The viewer
    application 'goview' is provided in Viewlib in order to view
    g2-files.


Good luck!
