IMPORTANT INFO:

On November 1th 2017 we plan to slightly change our branching
model. We will no longer let the "master" branch reference the "latest
stable release". The release will remain available as a tag. The
"master" branch will refer to our development branch (which until now
has been known as the "working" branch). The "working" branch will
live on until the end of November 2017, after which it will be
deleted, leaving the "master" branch as the only branch.

On November 1th 2017 we also plan to remove all deleted files from the
commit history, unfortunately rewriting the commit history in the
process. This will shrink the repository by a considerable amount of
data.

This text will be updated once the branching model is changed and the
purge is completed, upon which we advice all users to perform a
re-clone/re-fork.

GoTools is the name of a collection of C++ libraries related to
geometry. The libraries are organized as a core module with additional
modules added on top. The core module contains generic tools and
spline functionality. The additional modules contain functionality for
intersections, approximative implicitization, parametrization,
topology, and more.

This toolkit contains the modules GoTools Core, Parametrization,
Implicitization, Intersections, Igeslib, Trivariate, TrivariateModel,
CompositeModel, Topology, Viewlib, IsogeometricModel, LRsplines2D and
QualityModule. Also included is SISL, TTL and Newmat for convenience.

The GoTools geometry/spline toolkit was written by the Geometry Group
at SINTEF ICT, Department of Applied Mathematics.

Newmat was written by Robert Davies, http://www.robertnz.com.

Requirements:
* CMake - see: www.cmake.org
* For Viewlib only: Qt4, OpenGL, GLUT, Boost
* Linux: Tested with gcc version 4.7.3
* Windows: Tested with Visual Studio 2010. Should work on VS 2008.

A few comments on the current distribution:

(1) You can generate doxygen information by typing 'doxygen' in the base
    directory.
(2) In order to compile/install the library, you need to use CMake. See 
    the INSTALL file.
(3) GoTools provides a file format: g2. Various test applications
    produce g2 files as output. See the Doxygen generated
    documentation for more information on this format. The viewer
    application 'goview' is provided in Viewlib in order to view
    g2-files.


Good luck!
