2011-10-26: The gotools-all module now contains all the gotools code itself
            - i.e. not just svn:externals links to the real code. There are
            still links to a few non-gotools modules (cmake, sisl, ttl,
            newmat). Shouldn't be much difference in practice.

2011-03-15: Removed some bad dependencies of the cmake module. Updated
            a bunch of CMakeLists.txt. Seems to work on Windows.
            Works also on Linux.

=====
* Note: Outdated information! [jbt, 2011-10-26]

Meta-build module for all of GoTools including dependencies. Experimental.

The subdirectories in this module is connected via the svn:externals
mechanism. This includes both GoTools modules (gotools-core,
intersections, igeslib, etc.) and external libraries (SISL, TTL, newmat,
cmake).

More to come...
