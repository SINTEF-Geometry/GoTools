IMPORTANT INFO:

On November 1th 2017 we removed lots of deleted files from the commit
history, unfortunately rewriting the commit history in the
process. This purge did not remove any source files, it was limited to
data files (many of them moved to the new submodule gotools-data),
build files that had accidentally been pushed, etc. This shrinked the
repository by a considerable amount of data.

On November 2nd 2017 we slightly changed our branching model. The
"master" branch is now our development branch (it used to be the
"latest stable release". The "old master branch" remains available as
a tag.

We advice all users to perform a re-clone/re-fork. Make sure that you
keep any local changes in the process!

GoTools is the name of a collection of C++ libraries related to
geometry. The libraries are organized as a core module with additional
modules added on top. The core module contains generic tools and
spline functionality. The additional modules contain functionality for
intersections, approximative implicitization, parametrization,
topology, and more.

This toolkit contains the modules GoTools Core, Parametrization,
Implicitization, Intersections, Igeslib, Trivariate, TrivariateModel,
CompositeModel, Topology, Viewlib, IsogeometricModel, LRsplines2D and
QualityModule. Also included is SISL, TTL and Newmat for convenience.

The GoTools geometry/spline toolkit was written by the Geometry Group
at SINTEF ICT, Department of Applied Mathematics.

Newmat was written by Robert Davies, http://www.robertnz.com.

Requirements:
* CMake - see: www.cmake.org
* Linux: Tested with gcc version 4.8. Older versions are not supported.
* Windows: Tested with Visual Studio 2015. Older versions are not supported.

Dependencies:
* PugiXML
* JsonCpp
* Qt4/Qt5 (required for viewlib only)
* OpenGL (required for viewlib only)
* GLUT (required for viewlib only)

Optional dependencies (disabled by default):
* Boost (required for running the test suite)
* OpenMP

A few comments on the current distribution:

(1) You can generate doxygen information by typing 'doxygen' in the base
    directory.
(2) In order to compile/install the library, you need to use CMake. See 
    the INSTALL file.
(3) GoTools provides a file format: g2. Various test applications
    produce g2 files as output. See the Doxygen generated
    documentation for more information on this format. The viewer
    application 'goview' is provided in Viewlib in order to view
    g2-files.
