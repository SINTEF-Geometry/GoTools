Installation Instructions
*************************

Linux
*****

Install required packages:

$ sudo apt install -y git cmake make build-essential libgl1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev libpugixml-dev libjsoncpp-dev libboost-test-dev qtbase5-dev qtbase5-dev-tools

Git
***

The gotools module points to a repository on GitHub:
https://github.com/SINTEF-Geometry/GoTools.git.

GoTools contains three submodules (on GitHub):
GoTools-Data: https://github.com/SINTEF-Geometry/GoTools-Data.git,
SISL: https://github.com/SINTEF-Geometry/SISL.git, and
TTL: https://github.com/SINTEF-Geometry/TTL.git.

To clone the GoTools module, run:

$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/SINTEF-Geometry/GoTools.git

Alternatively use ssh:

$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:SINTEF-Geometry/GoTools.git

Initialize the submodules (not necessary if the clone-step used "--recursive"):

$ git submodule update --init

The branch 'master' is the only branch. Any releases will be available as tags.

CMake
*****

This GoTools package uses CMake to generate a Makefile (on Linux) or MS Visual Studio project file
(on Windows).

For information on using CMake, see www.cmake.org.

As a Quick Start Guide, on Linux, make a build directory somewhere:

$ cd some_dir
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ccmake <path_to_source_code>

Follow the instructions of 'ccmake' - the CMake "GUI". Then:

$ make
$ sudo make install

Compilers
*********

The code uses certain features of the new C++ standard C++11, most notably the smart pointer
std::shared_ptr. On Linux this has been tested using GCC 4.7.3 and newer. On Windows this has been
tested using Visual Studio 2010 and newer.

A set of options to control the build can be accessed in CMake (names starting with 'GoTools'). For
example, you can turn on/off building the various modules by checking/unchecking
GoTools_COMPILE_MODULE_<modulename>.

Also provided is the option GoTools_USE_BOOST. If this option is turned on, the building process
uses boost::shared_ptr instead of std::shared_ptr. If a C++11 compliant compiler is not available,
you may try this option and see if it works. Requires Boost: www.boost.org.

Windows
*********

The code has been tested using Visual Studio 2015, 2019 and 2022, with x64.

Make sure that your installment of Visual Studio includes support for Visual C++. When installing Visual
Studio you should select "Desktop development with C++" from the Workloads options. If you did not do
that then you must launch the Visual Studio installer and select "Modify", then select "Desktop
development with C++". Follow further instructions.

Note that Visual Studio introduced binary compatibility in Visual Studio 2015, allowing the user to mix
binaries built by the VS toolsets v140, v141, v142 and v143 (Visual Studio 2015 and later, with some
specific restrictions). The linker must use a toolset at least as recent as the newest toolset used by
the binaries.

How to edit environment variables:
- Open the settings application.
- Search for env, select: "Edit the system environment variables" (or "Edit environment variables for
  your account" to add them to your user only).

Boost:
- Download a binary release for your Visual Studio version.
- To help CMake find the boost install folder the BOOST_ROOT variable must be added to the system
  environment variables. This refers to the top level Boost folder (for instance 'C:\boost_1_74_0'),
  which contains both the 'boost' directory with the header files, as well as the folder with the
  Visual Studio binary libraries (like 'lib64-msvc-14.2').
- If you have multiple Visual Studio versions installed then all the corresponding binary library
  directories from the same Boost version should recide in the same BOOST_ROOT folder. CMake will
  pick the correct binaries.

Qt:
- Download a binary release for your Visual Studio version.
- To help CMake find the Qt install folder the QTDIR variable must be added to the system
  environment variables. This variable should point to the binary library directory, for instance
  'C:\Qt\5.15.2\msvc2019_64'.
- If you have more than one version of Visual Studio installed this variable may need to be changed
  accordingly if you switch to another version of Visual Studio. CMake must then be restarted and
  the cache deleted. Note that binary compatibility may deem this step unnecessary.
- You must also add the variable QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH to the system environment
  variables. This variable refers to the platform plugins and is set to
  '${QTDIR}\plugins\platforms'. Starting from a clean build the build process must be run twice in
  order to create the necessary Qt files.

PugiXML & JsonCpp:
- Both these libraries must be built from source (using cmake and Visual Studio). Fetch the source
  files from:
  - PugiXML: pugixml.org
  - JsonCpp: github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp
- Make sure that the cmake generator uses the correct version of Visual Studio and that the platform
  is set to x64.
- The include files and the built libraries may be set manually in CMake. A smoother approach is to
  adopt the convention that the include files are placed in the '~/Install/include/pugi' folder
  (replace with json for the json include files), while the library files are placed in the
  '~/Install/msvc2019_lib64/Release' folder (use Debug for the debug version of the libraries,
  change to msvc2015 for Visual Studio 2015).

OpenGL:
- If cmake does not find the gl.h and glu.h files they may be placed in the '~/Install/include/GL'
  folder.
- For computers without working OpenGL drivers (typically the case for virtual machines) MESA may be
  used (software rendering). In the folder with the application there is a library named
  'opengl32sw.dll'. This library should be copied and renamed to 'opengl32.dll', which will then be
  used by the application.

CMake:
- In order to run the testst you should add $CMAKE_DIR/bin to the PATH, allowing ctest.exe to be
  found.
- On Windows 10 the HOME variable is not set. This is needed by the cmake setup. Add HOME to the
  user environment variables, pointing to the home directory (typically 'C:\Users\<username>').
- For 64 bit applications using Visual Studio 2015 you should make sure to choose x64 when
  generating the solution (default is x86).

Building the gotools Visual Studio solution:
- Open the gotools Visual Studio solution file that was generated by cmake. Choose either Release or
  Debug, build the solution by pressing 'F7'.

Running the tests from a shell (like Git Bash):
- Run the tests in default (release) mode:
  $ ctest.exe
- Run the tests in debug mode:
  $ ctest.exe -C debug
- Run only the acceptance tests (use unit or integration for the other test types, using a unique
  substring like 'cep' will also work):
  $ ctest.exe -L acceptance


MacOS
*********

Although we do not provide official support for MacOS, GoTools should nonetheless compile without
issues. It has been tested on MacBook Pro (M1 Max with ARM64) running MacOS Monterey 12.0.1, using
the CLion IDE (version 2021.2.3). It should compile using other IDEs (like XCode) without any
issues.

We recommend using Homebrew to install the dependencies:
https://brew.sh

All dependencies may then be installed from the command line:
$ brew install pugixml
$ brew install boost
$ brew install qt5
$ brew install jsoncpp

Make sure that QTDIR is set to the base qt folder containing the bin and lib dirs, while Qt5_DIR
should be set to the folder containing the Qt5Config.cmake file (typically $QTDIR/lib/cmake/Qt5/).

There is no default support for OpenMP as it is not supported by Apple clang (version 13.0.0).
