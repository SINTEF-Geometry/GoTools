TODO isogeometric_model 3D-case:
--------------------------------

Missing functions:

VolBoundaryCondition:
- update(): Currently assuming solution is not to be approximated (setting it equal to 0.0).
  Class AdaptEvalSurface is needed for non-zero requirement.

testSfModel & testVolModel: sol->getBasisFunctionValues():
Slow: 12 min 2.9 sec for m36_outx_vols.g2, mostly in that function.
