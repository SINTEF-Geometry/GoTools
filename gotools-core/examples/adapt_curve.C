/// Description:
///  
/// This program demonstrates the use of the class AdaptCurve.
/// The class can generate a B-spline curve that approximates
/// an evaluator based curve to satisfy a given accuracy.
///
/// The program reads a 2D parameter curve and a surface from file, and
/// lifts the curve onto the surface to make an evaluator based curve.
/// This evaluator based curve are then used as input to the AdaptCurve
/// constructor.
///
/// Input/Output:
///
/// Input from the command line is the accuracy. (The maximum allowed distance
/// from the generated curve to the input curve.)
/// The file names of the input curve and surface are hardcoded to
/// "uproj_param_curve.g2" and "surface.g2".
///
/// Output is a file in Go-format for plotting the curve.
/// The file name is hard-coded to "adapt_lift_curve.g2". Together with
/// 'uproj_space_curve.g2 it can be viewed by program 'goview'.
/// If debug data are written in AdaptCurve, look at 'crv.out.g2' as well.
