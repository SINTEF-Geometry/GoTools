///  
/// This program demonstrates the use of the function
/// void CurveCreators::projectCurve(shared_ptr<ParamCurve>& space_cv,
///                                  shared_ptr<ParamSurface>& surf,

///			            shared_ptr<SplineCurve>& proj_cv,
///			            shared_ptr<SplineCurve>& par_cv)
///
/// The function generates a cubic spline curve(order four) which lies on a given
/// SplineSurface and is the projection of a given space curve (in 3D space) onto
/// that surface, within a given tolerance. The given space curve should be close
/// to the surface.
/// 
/// Input/Output:
///
/// Input to this program from the command line is the accuracy. (The maximum
/// allowed distance from the generated curve to the surface.)
/// The file names of the given spline curve and the surface are hardcoded 
/// to 'const_v_paramcurve.g2' and 'surface.g2'.
/// Output is one file with a 3D space curve 'proj_space_curve.g2' and a file
/// with a 2D parameter curve 'proj_param_curve.g2'.
/// The main purpose of the function is to get the parameter curve.
///
/// If the wanted tolerance can not be achieved, the message "Knot interval too
/// small" is displayed, but the curves are generated.
