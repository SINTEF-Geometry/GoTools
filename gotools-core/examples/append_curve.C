/// Description:
///
/// This program demonstrates the use of the function
/// SplineCurve::append_curve(void appendCurve(ParamCurve* other_curve,
///			     int continuity, 
///			     double& dist, 
///			     bool repar=true);
/// declared in SplineCurve.h.
/// The function joins two SplineCurves by appending the start of the second
/// curve to the end of the first curve. The two curves must be of the same type.
/// NOTE! The second curve will also be changed.
///
/// Input/Output
/// From the command line : Infile1  Infile2  continuity  Outfile
/// where Infile1 and  Infile2 are the name of files with the two input curves.
/// The files 'data/spline_ellipse_segm_org.g2' and
/// 'data/interpol_curve1_free.curve.g2' can be used as input files.
/// continuity is the level of continuity we demand at the transition between the
/// two curves (can be from -1 to order()-1, but the higher the value the more
/// will the curves have to be locally modified.
/// continuity = -1 inserts a straight line between the end point of the first
/// curve and the start point of the second curve.
/// continuity = 0 moves the end point of the first curve and the start point of
/// the second curve to the midpoint between them.
/// continuity = 1 is the default value when calling the short hand version
/// void appendCurve(ParamCurve* cv, bool repar=true);
/// Outfile is the name of the file where the new curve will be written.
