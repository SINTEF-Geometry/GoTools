In the following the file format corresponding to  most of the entities listed 
above will be described. Note that the g2-file format is a simple format that
does not support pointers. Thus, duplication of information may occur.

\section g2_sec_objectHeader The object header
All geometry entities are preceeded by the object 
\beginlink \link Go::ObjectHeader ObjectHeader\endlink in a stream.
ObjectHeader contains information about the class type of the
geometry object to folow and the version number of the file format. 
The format of the header
is as follows:
\arg \c <em> class type </em>. The entity code given in the list above.
\arg \c <em> major version </em>. Always 1.
\arg \c <em> minor version </em>. Always 0.
\arg \c <em> auxillerary data </em>. 0 if the default colour is chosen, 4 if the 
rgb-colour code is chosen. In the latter case, the entity is followed by 4 integer
digits between 0 and 255 giving the colours red, green and blue and the xxx.

\section g2_sec_splineCurve SplineCurve
The entity code 100 is given in the header. 
\beginlink \link Go::SplineCurve SplineCurve \endlink
continues with the following information
- dimension of geometry space, whether or not the curve is rational: 1=rational,
0=non-rational
- the number of coefficients, the polynomial order (i.e. degree+1)
- the knot vector, multiple knots are represented by giving the knot value
several times
- the curve coefficients

The curve coefficients are given continuously, normally divided by a carriage
return for each coefficient. The sequence is, in the non-rational case, 
\f$ (x_i, y_i, z_i), \quad
i=1, \ldots n \f$ where \f$ n \f$ is the number of coefficients. In the rational case,
the coefficients are given as \f$ (x_i h_i, y_i h_i, z_i h_i, h_i), \quad
i=1, \ldots n \f$. \f$h_i\f$ is the weight associated the current coefficient. 
Note that
the coefficients are represented with the weight multiplied with the \f$x\f$, 
\f$y\f$ and \f$x\f$-value.

A linear non-rational spline curve with no inner knots in the parameter interval 
\f$[0.1]\f$is including the header given as:
\verbatim
100 1 0 0 
3 0
2 2
0 0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
\endverbatim

\section g2_sec_curveOnSurface CurveOnSurface
The entity enumeration of a \beginlink \link Go::CurveOnSurface CurveOnSurface \endlink
is 110. The remaining file format is as follows:
- whether or not the parameter space curve is the master information (1=parameter
curve is master, 0=space curve is master), the entity type of the parameter curve
(0 if no such curve exists), the entity type of the space curve (0 if no such
curve exists)
- the description of the parameter curve according to the rules for that curve
type
- the description of the space curve according to the rules for that curve type

Either the parameter curve, the space curve or both are given. Information
regarding constant parameter information for the curve on surface is not covered
by the file format.

Note that the CurveOnSurface entity does also contain information about a 
\beginlink \link Go::ParamSurface ParamSurface\endlink. Thus, the g2-representation
of a CurveOnSurface is not stand alone. It needs to be combined with a \ref g2_sec_boundedSurface. That section gives an example of how the CurveOnSurface entity is used
in this context.

\section g2_sec_line Line
The unbounded \beginlink \link Go::Line line \endlink is given by the following 
information:

- the vector from the centre of the circle to the start point of the 
parametrization of the circle
The circle has an implicite parametrization from 0 to \f$ 2 \pi \f$ which is
not represented in the file format.

The entity enumeration for a circle is 130.

Example:
\verbatim

\endverbatim

- the dimension of the geometry space
- the major radius of the ellipse
- the minor radius of the ellipse
- the centre of the ellipse
- the normal of the plane in which the ellipse lies
- the vector from the centre of the ellipse to the start point of the ellipse
parametrization

The entity enumeration for an ellipse is 130.

\section g2_sec_boundedCurve Bounded Curve
A \beginlink \link Go::BoundedCurve bounded curve\endlink are expected to be bounded 
both parametrically and geometrically. Thus, a parameter on whether or not 
the limitation in the
parameter space or in geometry space is preffered is included in the format. The
format is:
- Whether the limitation in the parameter space is the master (1 if true)
- The start parameter of the bounded curve, the end parameter of the bounded curve
- The start point of the bounded curve in geometry space
- The end point of the bounded curve in geometry space
- The underlying curve described according to its entity type

All the information listed above is expected to be given in a g2-file. The 
corresponding entity enumeration is 150.

A bounded line from the point (0,0,0) to (1,0,0) where the position in space
is the master regarding the bounding points is expressed as
\verbatim
150 1 0 0
120 0 
0 1
3
0 0 0
1 0 0

3
0 0 0
1 0 0
\endverbatim
120 is the entity number for a line and the dimension of the geometry
space is 3.

\section g2_sec_splineSurface SplineSurface
The entity enumeration for a \beginlink \link Go::SplineSurface spline surface \endlink
is 200. The body of a spline surface is as follows:
- dimension of geometry space, whether or not the surface is rational: 1=rational,
0=non-rational
- the number of coefficients in the first parameter direction, 
the polynomial order in this direction (i.e. degree+1)
- the knot vector in the first parameter direction, 
multiple knots are represented by giving the knot value several times
- the number of coefficients in the second parameter direction, 
the polynomial order in this direction (i.e. degree+1)
- the knot vector in the second parameter direction
- the surface coefficients

The surface coefficients are given continuously and the 1. parameter direction
runs fastest. The sequence is
\f$ (x_{(1,1)}, y_{(1,1)}, z_{(1,1)}), (x_{(2,1)}, y_{(2,1)}, z_{(2,1)}),
\ldots, (x_{(n,1)}, y_{(n,1)}, z_{(n,1)}), (x_{(1,2)}, y_{(1,2)}, z_{(1,2)}),
\ldots, (x_{(n,2)}, y_{(n,2)}, z_{(n,2)}), \ldots, (x_{(1,m)}, y_{(1,m)}, z_{(1,m)}),
\ldots,  (x_{(n,m)}, y_{(n,m)}, z_{(n,m)}) \f$. Here \f$n\f$ is the number of 
coefficients in the 1. parameter direction, and \f$m\f$ is the number of coefficients
in the 2. parameter direction. The weights are multiplied with the coefficients
similarily to the case for the spline curve and is given as an extra entity for
each coefficient, again similar to the curve case.

A simple non-rational, bilinear surface with no inner knots is represented as:
\verbatim
200 1 0 0 
3 0
2 2
0 0 1 1
2 2
0 0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
0 1 0
1 1 0
\endverbatim

\section g2_sec_boundedSurface BoundedSurface
\beginlink \link Go::BoundedSurface BoundedSurface\endlink has entity enumeration 210.
A bounded surface consists of an underlying rectangular parametric surface and one
or more trimming loops. The file format body consists of the following information:
<ul>
<li> The underlying surface represented according to its type
<li> The number of trimming loops
<li> For each trimming loop
<ol>
<li> The number of curves in the current trimming loop
<li> The tolerance within which the loop is found to be continuous
<li> The curves in the trimming loop, one by one
</ol>
</ul>
The trimming curves are of type \beginlink \link Go::ParamCurve ParamCurve\endlink, 
but it most cases they will be represented as \ref g2_sec_curveOnSurface.

The following example illustrates the format a bounded surface. The underlying
surface is a plane as can be seen from the entity number in line two.
The 3 curves in the trimming loop are all of type CurveOnSurface. Note that
the entity number of CurveOnSurface does not appear. The space curve
corresponding to the curve on surface is the master, and the only curve
describing the trimming curve. This is given by the line <em> 0 0 100 </em> 
which occur for every curve and is to be interpreted: <em> the space curve is 
the master, the parameter curve does not exist, the space curve is a 
spline curve </em>. Following this line is the body of a spline curve in the
g2-format.
\verbatim
210 1 0 0
250 
3
0 0 0
0 0 1
1 0 0

1
3 0.0001

0 0 100
3 0
2 2
0 0 1 1
-1 0 0
0 -1 0

0 0 100
3 0
2 2
0 0 1 1
0 -1 0
-0.5 2 0

0 0 100
3 0
4 3
0 0 0 0.5 1 1 1
-0.5 2 0
-1 2 0
-2 1 0
-1 0 0

the last one is of order 3 (degree 2) and has one inner knot. All the curves
are non-rational.
