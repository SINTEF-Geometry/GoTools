\page gotools_examples GoTools example files

A number of example programs are created to illustrate the use of various
GoTools functionality.

Example programs in gotools-core:
- \ref adapt_curve
- \ref append_curve
- \ref approx_curve
- \ref approx_surface
- \ref circle
- \ref closestpoint_curve
- \ref closestpoint_degenerate_sf
- \ref closestpoint_surface
