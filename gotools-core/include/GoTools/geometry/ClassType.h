/** All concrete classes that inherit GeomObject should
 *  have a matching enum in ClassType. It is necessary to
 *  have a central location for the type identification numbers,
 *  so that two classes in different modules (for example) does
 *  not try to use the same number. At the same time, it is
 *  something we'd like to avoid, because it forces you to
 *  update this file every time you add a new GeomObject-
 *  inheriting class.
 *
 *  If you need to add a new type, you may also need to add a "Registrator",
 *  see the 'GoTools' class. If the new class is part of 'geometry' in
 *  'gotools-core', do this in the init() function of the GoTools class
 *  itself. If it's outside the core, then write another class with its own
 *  static init() function containing the Registrator.
 *
 *  Also, if you need the name of that added type, i.e. a ClassType-to-string
 *  conversion, then you should add that as well. See GoTools::className().
