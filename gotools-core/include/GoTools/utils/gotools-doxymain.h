/// \mainpage GoTools Library
/// \section d0 Introduction
///
/// The newest version og GoTools is available from <a
/// href="http://www.sintef.no/Geometry-Toolkits">http://www.sintef.no/Geometry-Toolkits</a>.
///
/// GoTools is licensed under the <a
/// href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public
/// License </a>
///
/// GoTools is the group name of many interdependent C++ software
/// modules developed by the geometry group at SINTEF ICT, Dept. of
/// Applied Mathematics.  GoTools software has been developed for a
/// range of different applications in many different projects.
/// However, a few key modules are used by almost all the others;
/// these have been grouped together in the \ref gotools-core.
///
/// At the moment, the following GoTools modules are offered with GPL license:
/// \li \ref geometry_doc. Parametric curves and surfaces including construction 
/// methods and operations on these entities
/// \li \ref parametrization.  Parametrization of scattered data points
/// \li \ref implicitization. Approximating spline curves and surfaces by 
/// implicitely defined algebraic entities
/// \li \ref intersections. Intersection functionality involving spline curves and 
/// surfaces and computations of self intersections.
/// \li \ref igeslib. Read from and write to iges format. 
/// \li \ref trivariate. Spline volumes and elementary volumes
/// including some creation methods
/// \li \ref topology. Adjacency analysis for surface sets
/// \li \ref compositemodel. Representation of a surface set including topological
/// entities and operations on a set of surfaces as one unit.
/// \li \ref trivariatemodel. A volume model including topology and some operations 
/// on the model
/// \li \ref viewlib. A utility viewer to visualize curves and surfaces
///
/// GoTools depends on:
/// \li <a href="http://www.sintef.no/SISL">SISL</a> (available with
/// GPL license), SINTEF's spline library, for various spline related functionality,
/// \li <a href="http://www.robertnz.net">newmat</a> (available with a permissive license), for various matrix operations.
///
/// For convenience, these libraries are included in the GPL version of GoTools.
