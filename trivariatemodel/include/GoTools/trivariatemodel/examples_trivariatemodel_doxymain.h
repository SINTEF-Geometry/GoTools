             Build a volume model representing a simplified mid ship,
             hull with stiffeneres in both directions and deck.
             The model is represented as a block structured volume
             model.

\example mirrorAndLoft example_mirrorAndLoft.C
\verbatim
\endverbatim
This program demonstrates how to create a volume model from a set
of spline surfaces. The surfaces must be connected. The surface set
is mirrored around a given plane, and lofting between corresponding 
surfaces is performed.

\example multiPatchSweep multiPatchSweep.C
\verbatim
\endverbatim
The idea of this program is to sweep a set surfaces to create a multi patch 
volume model.
The surface set will be created by the example programs in compositemodel:
createSplitDisc and createBlockStructuredDisc
