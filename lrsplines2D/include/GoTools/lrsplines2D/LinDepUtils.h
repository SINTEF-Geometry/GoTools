  // is a SUFFICIENT condition for linear INDEPENDENCE of the LR
  // B-splines, or equivalently, the LR spline UNPEELABILITY is a
  // NECESSARY condition for linear DEPENDENCE of the LR B-splines. If
  // an LR spline IS peelable, the LR B-splines are linearly
  // INdependent. If the LR spline is NOT peelable, the LR B-splines
  // MAY be linearly dependent, and further investigations are
  // required to determine whether some of the LR B-splines are
