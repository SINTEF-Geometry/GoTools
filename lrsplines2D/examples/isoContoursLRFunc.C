/// Input to the example is read from
/// gotools/gotools-data/lrsplines2D/examples/data. The path is hardcoded.
/// Note that the example must be run from a build directory directly
/// placed under gotools to find the data. With another location, modify
/// the path.
/// The resulting curves in geometry and parameter space is written to
/// data/iso_cvs_3D.g2 and data/iso_cvs_par.g2, respectively. In the first
/// case, the two first coordinates are given by the parameter
/// domain curves while the height value constitutes the last coordinate.
