/// Description:
/// Read point cloud from file. The given point cloud represents a function
/// with diagonal steep area and a local elevation.
/// Set appropriate parameters and approximate the points with an LR surface
/// in 1D (function). The point cloud is parameterized on its
/// x- and y-parameters.
///
/// The app PointCloud2LR performs the same operations taking a point cloud
/// as input. Several parameters are also given as input (mandatory and
/// optional). Use -h to get an explanation of all parameters.
///
/// Input to the example is read from
/// gotools/gotools-data/lrsplines2D/examples/data. The path is hardcoded.
/// Note that the example must be run from a build directory directly
/// placed under gotools to find the data. With another location, modify
/// the path.
/// The resulting surface and corresponding mesh is written to
/// data/approx_lrfunc.g2 and data/approx_mesh.eps. The point cloud in
/// g2-format (for visualization) is written to data/pointcloud.g2
