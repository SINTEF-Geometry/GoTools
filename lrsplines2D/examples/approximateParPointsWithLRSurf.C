/// Description:
/// Read point cloud from file. The given point cloud represents a function
/// with diagonal steep area and a local elevation. Each points is
/// equipped with a parameter pair.
/// Set appropriate parameters and approximate the points with an LR surface
/// in 3D).
/// The input data set is the parameterized version of the data set
/// given as input to approximateWithLRFunc.C
///
/// The app PointCloud2LR performs the same operations taking a point cloud
/// as input. Several parameters are also given as input (mandatory and
/// optional). The optional parameter -par must be set to 1. This choice
/// requires a parameterized point cloud. Use -h to get an explanation of
/// all parameters.
///
/// Input to the example is read from
/// gotools/gotools-data/lrsplines2D/examples/data. The path is hardcoded.
/// Note that the example must be run from a build directory directly
/// placed under gotools to find the data. With another location, modify
/// the path.
/// The resulting surface and corresponding mesh is written to
/// data/approx_lrsurf.g2 and data/approx_mesh2.eps.
