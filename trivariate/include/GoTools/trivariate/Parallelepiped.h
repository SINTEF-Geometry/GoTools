  /// ElementaryVolume, and thus has a parametrization.
  ///
  /// A Parallelepiped has a natural parametrization in terms
  /// of the distances \a u, \a v and \a w along the edges:
  /// \b p(\a u, \a v, \a w) = \b C + \a u \b x + \a v \b y + \a w \b z.
  /// The parametrization is bounded by: \f$0 \leq u \leq a\f$, \f$0 \leq v \leq b\f$,
  /// \f$0 \leq w \leq c\f$, where \a a, \a b, \a c are the edge lengths. The dimension is 3.
