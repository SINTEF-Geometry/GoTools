/// \page implicitization GoTools Implicitization
///
/// Contains tools for implicitizing spline curves and surfaces. Also
/// contains various classes for Bernstein polynomials.
/// 
/// Historically, the underlying ideas for implicitzation and
/// approximate implicitization were developed by Tor Dokken at
/// SINTEF, ICT, in his Ph.D. thesis: <a
/// href="http://www.sintef.no/upload/IKT/9011/geometri/GAIA%20II/Ph_D_Dokken_1997.pdf">Aspects
/// of Intersection Algorithms and Approximation</a>, University of
/// Oslo, Norway, 1997.
///
/// The implementations in this library was done in connection with
/// the EU projects <a href="http://www.sintef.no/IST_GAIA">GAIA I and
/// II</a>.
///
/// This module depends on the newmat matrix library, which is freely
/// available from <a href="http://www.robertnz.net/">www.robertnz.net</a>.
