/// \mainpage GoTools Implicitization
///
/// Contains tools for implicitizing spline curves and surfaces. Also
/// contains various classes for Bernstein polynomials.
/// 
/// Historically, the underlying ideas for implicitzation and
/// approximate implicitization were developed by Tor Dokken at
/// SINTEF, ICT, in his Ph.D. thesis: <a
/// href="http://www.sintef.no/upload/IKT/9011/geometri/GAIA%20II/Ph_D_Dokken_1997.pdf">Aspects
/// of Intersection Algorithms and Approximation</a>, University of
/// Oslo, Norway, 1997. The implementations in this library was done
/// in connection with the EU projects <a
/// href="http://www.sintef.no/IST_GAIA">GAIA I and II</a>.
///
/// This module depends on:
/// - The GoTools Core library
/// - SISL
/// - The newmat matrix library, which is freely available from <a
/// href ="http://www.robertnz.net/">www.robertnz.net</a>.

/// \namespace Go
/// The Go namespace is the common namespace for all GoTools modules.
